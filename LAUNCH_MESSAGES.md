**Title: [LAUNCH] Built a platform for real mock interviews with FAANG engineers - Codementee**

Hey everyone! 👋

After lurking here for months and seeing countless posts about interview prep struggles, I decided to build something different.

**The Problem:** Most interview prep is generic. You practice on LeetCode but don't know what Amazon's bar-raiser actually looks for, or how Google's L4 interview differs from L5.

**The Solution:** Codementee - real mock interviews with engineers who've actually worked at your target company.

**What's Different:**
• Company-specific tracks (Amazon SDE vs Google L4 vs Meta E3)
• Real mentors from target companies (not random tutors)
• Professional mentor assignment (we match based on your goals)
• Transparent pricing - no subscription traps
• Free exploration - see mentors and pricing before paying

**Pricing:** ₹1,999 (1 mock) to ₹8,999 (6 mocks) - way cheaper than other platforms

**Free to explore:** You can register, see mentors, check pricing, explore features - all free. Only pay when you're ready to book.

Would love feedback from this community! 🙏

**Disclaimer:** This is my project, but I genuinely think it solves a real problem many of us face.
